# NLP-Based Chatbot for Customer Support in Financial Services

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent chatbot system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide automated and interactive customer support within the financial services domain. It is designed to simulate human-like conversations to assist users in resolving queries related to banking, insurance, investment, and other financial services.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To automate customer support using a smart chatbot that can handle diverse user queries related to financial services.
* To reduce manual workload on human agents by offering accurate, 24/7 automated assistance.
* To integrate a user-friendly interface that allows seamless interaction between customers and the chatbot.
* To analyze and understand customer queries using NLP and respond with appropriate and relevant information.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras (for ML models), Flask (for deployment)
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
* **Database:** SQLite / NoSQL (optional, for storing user interaction logs)
* **NLP Embeddings**	GloVe 

## 🧠 System Modules

1. **User Interface (UI):**

   * Enables users to input queries and view chatbot responses.
   * Built with a simple and intuitive design for ease of use.

2. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**

   * Tokenization, Lemmatization, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition.
   * Converts raw text into structured data.

3. **Intent Classification & Response Generation:**

   * Classifies user intent using machine learning models.
   * Generates appropriate responses either from a pre-defined dataset or via dynamic logic.

4. **Knowledge Base / FAQ Integration:**

   * Provides information on financial services such as loans, insurance, accounts, etc.

5. **Training & Testing:**

   * Utilizes labeled datasets for training.
   * Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

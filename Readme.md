# NLP-Based Chatbot for Customer Support in Financial Services

## 📌 Project Overview

**VITAL-D Chat** (Virtual Intelligent Transactional Assistant for Logistics & Dialogue) is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide conversational financial assistance to users. It enables users to track expenses, receive financial insights, and manage personal finances through a natural language interface. The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models** with **GloVe word embeddings** for accurate intent recognition and response generation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To build a chatbot that offers automated financial assistance using NLP.
* To help users track expenses, view analytics, and manage spending via natural conversation.
* To ensure secure, personalized, and intelligent interaction with financial data.

## 🧠 System Modules

1. **User Interface**

   * Registration, login, chatbot interaction, and graphical analytics.

2. **NLP Engine**

   * Uses GloVe embeddings to convert text to vectors.
   * Processes intent and context using LSTM-based models.

3. **Intent Classification**

   * Classifies user queries into intents like balance check, spending, savings, etc.

4. **Dialogue Manager**

   * Uses sequence modeling to maintain conversation flow.

5. **Database Management**

   * Stores user credentials, expense details, and transaction history securely.

## 🖥️ Output Screenshots

Below are a few screenshots showcasing the key features and functionality of the **VITAL-D Chatbot** web application:

### 🔐 1. User Registration & Login

Users can register with basic information like name, income, and account balance. Registered users can securely log in using Django's built-in authentication system.
